# Restaurant App

This restaurant app is a fun app I created to try to replicate a website someone would find for a fancy restaurant

There are 4 pages, the Home, Menu, Reserve, and About Us page. An example of a page is shown below:

( A part of the menu page which contains some beautiful dishes, along with the price and ratings ).

## Resources Used
For this project, I used mainly HTML and CSS. However, I also used javascript to incorporate the responsiveness ( the hamburger menu ) into each page. I also used Bootstrap for the carousel towards the end of the main page, and Font Awesome for the various fonts throughout the website
